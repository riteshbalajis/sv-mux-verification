# sv-mux-verification
System Verilog testbench for a parameterized MUX where the size is controlled by DEPTH, LENGTH, and SELECTION_WIDTH. Includes clock, reset, stimulus generators, and output validation. Works on both clock edges and verifies correctness using randomized test cases. Displays pass/fail results for debugging.
