# SystemVerilog MUX Testbench

##  Overview

This is a **SystemVerilog testbench** for a **parameterized multiplexer (MUX)**.  
The MUX size is **fully configurable** using parameters like 'DEPTH', 'LENGTH', and 'SELECTION_WIDTH'.  

This testbench **automates verification** by generating clock and reset signals, applying randomized test cases, and validating the output—making debugging much easier!

##  What This Testbench Does:
✅ Supports **dynamic MUX sizes**  
✅ Works on **both clock edges**  
✅ Generates **randomized test cases**  
✅ Checks output against expected values  
✅ Clearly reports **pass/fail** results
